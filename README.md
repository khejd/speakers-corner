 ##About
 Speaker's Box is a group project by [ELSYS](https://www.ntnu.no/studier/mtelsys)-students at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in the subject 'Electronic System Design, Project'.
 The main idea of the project is to collect peoples thoughts about what's on their mind, and to publish them on a webpage, where others can give feedback in terms of up- and down-votes.
 
 Speaker's Box is a physical box which is placed somewhere in Trondheim, and from this box, people are able to publish whatever they want. The application runs on a Raspberry Pi with a 7" touchscreen and has a microphone people can talk into.
 There is no keyboard on the box, so the application is dependent on a speech-to-text API.
 
 ####What's next?
 The project grew bigger than I first thought. Next time I will definitely use a web framework to get a better structure of the files and more reusable code.
